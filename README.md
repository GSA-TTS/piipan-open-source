## Overview

Piipan is a reference model for program integrity initiatives that aim to prevent multiple enrollment in federally-funded, but state-managed benefit programs. It is the open-source foundation for the [USDA Food and Nutrition Service](https://www.fns.usda.gov) National Accuracy Clearinghouse (NAC), a congressionally mandated matching system for the [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program).

Under this model:
1. State eligibility systems share *de-identified* participant data to Piipan daily

</p>

2. Duplicate participation is prevented by using Piipan to search for matches during eligibility (re)certification

</p>

Paramount quality attributes of this system include:
* Preserving the privacy of program participants
* Accuracy of matches
* Adaptability to multiple benefit programs

[Sec. 4011 of the 2018 Farm Bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2/text), *Interstate data matching to prevent multiple issuances*, further guides our work, mandating that the information made available by state agencies:
* Shall be used only for the purpose of preventing multiple enrollment
* Shall not be retained for longer than is necessary

To achieve this product vision, Piipan incorporates a Privacy-Preserving Record Linkage (PPRL) technique to de-identify the PII of program participants at the state-level. Please see our [high-level treatment](./docs/pprl-plain.md) and our [technical specification](./docs/pprl.md) for more details.

**Note**: Our documentation will sometimes use the terms Piipan and NAC interchangeably. However, more precisely, Piipan is our [open-source product available on GitHub](https://github.com/18F/piipan), while the NAC is a deployment of that product, configured specifically for the Food and Nutrition Service, and operated under their policies and regulations. 

## Documentation

[High-level architecture](./docs/architecture.md), process, and (sub)system documentation, as well as Architectural Decision Records (ADRs), are organized in [this index](./docs/README.md).

## Development

Piipan is implemented with .NET and Microsoft Azure, using a Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Function as a Service (FaaS) approach.

Piipan is organized into [subsystems](./docs/adr/0018-standardize-subsystem-software-architecture.md). A subsystem can contain one or more .NET projects. Each subsystem has a top-level `build.bash` script that can run builds, unit tests, and deployments for all projects in its subsystem.

Piipan also has a top-level `build.bash` script that can perform these operations for all subsystems.

### Dependencies

Install Piipan's list of [prerequisites](./docs/iac.md#prerequisites) before starting development.

### How to Build

Once the prerequisites are installed in a development environment, you can locally build all projects in a particular subsystem by navigating to it's top-level directory and executing `build.bash`.

Example:

```bash
$ cd match
$ ./build.bash
```

To build all subsystems at once, navigate to Piipan's top-level directory and execute `./build.bash`

### How to Test

For a more detailed analysis on testing best practices in NAC, review the following guide:
* [Server-Side Automated Testing](https://github.com/18F/piipan/tree/dev/docs/server-side-automated-testing-guide.md)

#### Unit Tests

Run all unit tests for a particular subsystem by navigating to it's top-level directory and executing `build.bash test`.

Example:

```
$ cd match
$ ./build.bash test
```

When testing, an optional flag [-c] can be passed to run in Continuous Integration mode:

Example:

```
$ ./build.bash test -c
```

To run all subsystem unit tests at once, navigate to Piipan's top-level directory and run `./build.bash test`.

#### Integration Tests

A subsystem may have one or more integration test suites. Because they require containerized environments, each integration test suite must be run individually. Consult each subsystem documentation for integration testing instructions.

### How to Deploy

Deploy all projects for a particular subsystem by navigating to it's top-level directory and executing `build.bash deploy -e [env]`.

Example:

```
$ cd match
$ ./build.bash deploy -e tts/dev
```

To deploy all Piipan subsystems, navigate to Piipan's top-level directory and execute `build.bash deploy -e [env]`.

These scripts rely on a top-level [solutions (sln) file](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-sln) for each subsystem. See [tools/build-common.bash](./tools/build-common.bash) for more details.

As an alternative for deploying with the bash scripts, you may choose to use Visual Studio's publish feature. This allows you to publish with just a few clicks without ever having to leave Visual Studio. Before you are able to complete these steps, you must:
- Set up VS to utilize Azure Gov Cloud (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-government/documentation-government-connect-vs) 
- In Visual Studio, go to File-> Account Settings and add your account
- In Visual Studio, go to Tools -> Options -> Azure Service Authentication and chose your account you just added

To do so, right click the project you want to publish and select Publish. On the publish window, add a New publish profile by clicking the "+ New" button. On this screen, connect to your Azure resource that you would like to publish to. You may need to re-enter your Azure credentials on this screen. If you do, you will need to enter them, close out of the publish dialog, and start the process over.

A few additional things to note when publishing web applications:
- Make sure to publish the main application, not the Client one. For example, publish Piipan.QueryTool, not Piipan.QueryTool.Client.
- You will need the correct appsettings.*.json file for your environment. Please contact a team member and they will show you where the files can be found. Do NOT check this file into GitHub!
- If you get errors in the Javascript console because of "Integrity" issues, it's possible your deployment files got some bad files in it. Usually this occurs when upgrading to a newer version of a NPM package and still having a copy of the old one in your bin and/or obj folders. To fix this, delete your bin and obj folders in both the main project and the Client project and try again.

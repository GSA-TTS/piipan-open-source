**Help Desk Contract** 
-------------------

The NAC will be supported by a separate Help Desk support vendor who will handle Tier 1 and Tier 2 support. The Help Desk support contract has not been awarded and is expected to be in place by the second quarter of FY 2022. 

Until the Help Desk support contract is awarded, the software development team will support the initial group of 3-5 states integrating the NAC with any technical needs.

Once the Help Desk contract has been awarded, all user issues will be directly routed to the Help Desk vendor via the FNS trouble ticketing system. The Help Desk vendor will be responsible for providing Tiers 1-2 support to users. Tier 3 or higher will be handled by the software development team. 

**Tiers 1-3 Support**
-----------------

Tier 1 is defined as a basic user issue such as password resets and creating user accounts. Another indicator of a Tier 1 issue is that it can be resolved by following a detailed script.

Tier 2 is defined as a more complex user issue that is beyond a Tier 1 issue but does not require changes to the system code, API, or any other backend portion of the NAC. For example, "I need help with a file upload."

Tier 3 (or higher) is defined as any user issue that requires a developer to make changes to the system code, API, or any other backend portion of the NAC. For example: "I'm the systems admin in Ohio and our batch upload failed last night, I need to figure out why."

The Help Desk vendor will be responsible for detailed documentation of reported Tier 3 issues within the FNS trouble ticketing system so the software development team can triage and resolve.

Current FNS Help Desk Process
-------------------------------

### Ticketing Process

The below is an example of the help desk ticketing process that is currently following in FNS.

1.  User submits an issue/inquiry through email or a phone call. 

2.  Tier 1 processes the issue upon receipt. 

    a.  Tier 1 performs ticket analysis to determine the response or action necessary. If appropriate, Tier 1 will determine the root cause. 

    b.  Tier 1 creates a Jira ticket using e-Jira to keep track of the issue. 

    c.  Tier 1 will assign the Jira tickets - immediate ownership and responsibility is established and facilitates follow up if needed. 

3.  When Tier 1 requires additional research involving technical analysis, the Jira ticket will be escalated to Tier 2. 

    a.  Tier 2 performs technical analysis. 

    b.  Tier 2 utilizes the information shared from Tier 1 along with their expertise to recommend a resolution. 

    c.  Tier 2 determines if a Change Request (CR) will be needed to resolve the issue. 

4.  Tier 1 monitors the ticket from beginning to end (Open to Close), to ensure timely responses and resolutions. 

Notes from the team's analysis will be recorded with the Jira item for tracking and future reference.  

### Priority guidelines  

There are priority guidelines defined for the tickets that are reported by users and the corresponding response time from Helpdesk support. 

    Priority 1 (P1) -- 0-2h response time 

    Priority 2 (P2) -- 0-4h response time 

    Priority 3 (P3) -- 0-24h response time 

    Priority 4 (P4) --24-48h response time (can be delayed if needed for additional 48h)

**Number of State Users**
---------------------

The Help Desk will eventually support users in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories of Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Users of the NAC system will be limited to state employees and can vary from 5,000 users to over 50,000 depending on many factors including if state eligibility workers from every state will be accessing the NAC. 

However, at the time of award, there will be as few as four states that will be using the system but over time, this number will increase. The estimated timeline for when all 53 state agencies will be using the NAC is shown in the State Implementation section of this document.

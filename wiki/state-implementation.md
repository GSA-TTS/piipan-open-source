Current states in NAC Group 1 
------------------------------

After assessing the feasibility of several states that volunteered to be part of the NAC initial rollout, 18F + FNS selected 10 states that were best equipped to integrate the system first. The Group 1 states include three rankings (Group 1A, 1B, and 1C) based on their technical readiness, ability to meet the timeline, available resources, and other criteria.

The four states selected to be part of Group 1A have been working closely with the NAC project team to provide feedback and collaboratively co-design the NAC system so it causes minimal delay and burden on eligibility workers and SNAP recipients. The six states in Group 1B and 1C have also participated in regular check-ins and research sessions with the NAC project team, and are next in line to integrate the NAC after the Group 1A states.

Three of the four states in Group 1A have begun testing the NAC APIs in the test environment and have prioritized integration for a 2022 launch. There will be a phased launch approach, with the remaining seven states in Group 1 launching after the initial three states.

State relationship management
-----------------------------

The NAC project team is in regular communication with NAC Group 1 state partners in an effort to learn from the state user experience and provide technical support for state developers working on the integration. This state relationship management includes (but is not limited to):

-   Develop and maintain relationships with states and serve as navigators to help states plan for implementation and integration and support them through successful implementation, onboarding, and rollout

-   Coordinate regular communication with NAC state partners, including check-in calls with states to track integration progress

-   Facilitate user research sessions with state partners

-   Provide technical support in areas of integration testing, troubleshooting, and any areas that require support with connecting state systems to the NAC

-   Facilitate collaboration when needed between new states coming on board to the NAC and states that have already integrated with the system

-   Create onboarding materials to share with new states joining the NAC and make sure they're well-prepared for NAC implementation, such as a pre-certification checklist to assist state agencies as they work toward implementation 

-   Draft updates for the Help Desk scripts that will then be shared with states in need of support 

-   Provide regular updates to FNS on state implementation progress, including any current or expected potential challenges states are experiencing 

-   Develop tools to assist state integration, such as tools to validate conformance with the NAC API specification

Timeline for states integrating the NAC
---------------------------------------

FNS anticipates that most states will be able to integrate the NAC by 2025 or 2026. The phased launch approach will follow a bell shaped curve: fewer states will launch initially as we continue making improvements, more states will launch in the middle as we gain efficiency, and the remaining states will launch at the end that may be slow for reasons outside the vendor team's control. This estimate is contingent upon states making the NAC a priority.

Fiscal Year (FY) 2022: The initial four states in Group 1 will aim to launch the NAC in FY 2022, followed by a period of 3-6 months of no states onboarding in order to observe their initial experiences and keep making improvements.

FY 2023: The remaining six states in Group 1 should be able to join along with six additional states, for a total of 12 states implementing in FY 2023.

FY 2024 and 2025: FNS anticipates the NAC onboarding process will gain efficiency and hit a stride, with 16 states joining in FY 2024 and 16 more states in FY 2025. This would be a total of 48 states by the end of FY 2025.

FY 2026: The remaining 5 states that are last to launch might be slow for reasons outside of the vendor team's control. This might be due to outdated technical systems, unavailable team resources, or other unexpected delays. It will take longer for these states to integrate the NAC given their constraints.

Onboarding new states
---------------------

FNS must approve States before they are onboarded. States will need to change their eligibility system software and update their matching procedures to take the proper actions on NAC matches. The vendor, in collaboration with FNS, will need to observe and coach new states as they onboard, and set parameters they must meet before going live in the system. The vendor  will develop an onboarding kit to help states properly prepare for implementation of the NAC. The kit will provide information about preparations needed for successful adoption of the NAC system and policy requirements, including a checklist of steps the state must affirm they have taken before they may use the system to take action on cases as the result of NAC matches.
